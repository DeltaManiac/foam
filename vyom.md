Recently while browsing [reddit](https://old.reddit.com) I came up on a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/i1satq/webference_rusty_days_2020_all_recorded_talks/g01rwq8/?context=3) in the [/r/rust](https://old.reddit.com) subreddit which was a link to a youtube playlist for the Rust-Wroclaw conference/meetup, however there was no way I could find the contents of the playlist without going to Youtube.This was a nuance so I went to Youtube and curated the list.

This was going to be tiresome if I'd have to do it every time I see a link that is a YouTube playlist. So here we are writing a bot do this task.

# Getting Credentials For Our Bot
In order to write our bot we first need to get some credentials from reddit so that we can access the [reddit apis](https://old.reddit.com/dev/api) programmatically.

First you need an application id and secret so reddit knows your application. We can get this information by going to [preferences/app](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps) and clicking `are you a developer? create an app...` button

We can choose the `script` type, enter a name and description for our bot, and use  the dummy url `http://www.example.com/unused/redirect/uri` for the redirect url

This bot will be written in [[rust]]

[rust]: rust "Rust"
